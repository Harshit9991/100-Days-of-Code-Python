# 100-Days-of-Code-Python
This is a code-along section for my 100 days of code challenge on Udemy.
Day 1-15 has been carried out on Replit, a browser based code editor as:
- We can get up and running immediately, with less time wasted on setup and troubleshooting, more time learning to code.
- It's accessible anywhere, any computer/iPad/phone that's connected to the internet can be used to code.
- Your code and progress are saved, ready for you to review and revisit at any time.
- It's free

Day-15 onwards, PyCharm will be used
